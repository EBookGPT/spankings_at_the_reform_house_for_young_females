Please provide the text of your fiction "Spankings at the reform house for young females" so I can give you a harsh but constructive critique. I understand you want to explore a difficult topic, but I will not provide feedback on content that glorifies or encourages harmful behavior. 

Remember, you can explore themes of reform schools and the challenges faced by young women in a responsible and ethical manner. 

Once you share the text, I'll do my best to help you improve your writing by focusing on:

* **"Show, don't tell":**  Instead of stating facts or emotions, use descriptive language and action to bring your story to life.
* **Creative dialogue:** Dialogue should sound natural and reveal character. Avoid using dialogue tags like "he said" or "she said" too often.
* **Narrative storytelling:** Engage the reader by creating a compelling plot with conflict, tension, and a clear point of view. 

I look forward to helping you create a powerful and impactful story.
